          <title>Background</title>
          <p id="Par1">Stigma is a social process that impedes access to support for mental health conditions and alcohol and other drug (AOD) use, particularly for people from migrant and ethnic minority backgrounds. There is limited understanding, however, of people&#x2019;s experiences of stigma, the underlying drivers, intersections with ethnicity, gender, and citizenship status, and how powerful discourses and social institutions create and perpetuate systems of stigma. This review aims to synthesise and critically analyse qualitative evidence to understand how stigma associated with mental health conditions and AOD use operates among people from migrant and ethnic minority groups.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p id="Par2">Qualitative evidence will be identified using MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Applied Social Sciences Index and Sociological Abstracts. Two reviewers will screen the titles, abstracts and full-text articles. Eligible studies will include original, empirical, peer-reviewed qualitative evidence, published in English since 1990. Studies must examine stigma in relation to mental health conditions, illicit drug use or alcohol consumption among participants who are from migrant and ethnic minority backgrounds. Studies will be critically appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for qualitative studies and the level of confidence in the findings will be assessed using Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research. Data will be analysed using the &#x2018;best fit&#x2019; framework synthesis approach, drawing on the Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par9">Over the past decade, the global burden of disease from mental health conditions has increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. On average, one in three adults experience a common mental health condition in their lifetime including mood, anxiety and substance use disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. People from migrant and ethnic minority backgrounds (defined as populations other than the dominant majority of a country in terms of numerical proportions and power positions, particularly migrants, refugees, people seeking asylum and minority groups from non-main English-speaking countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]) may be at higher risk of mental health conditions and substance use disorders than the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Risk factors include increased experiences of trauma, acculturation stress, and social and economic disadvantage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Research suggests that some young people from refugee backgrounds report heavy alcohol consumption to cope with trauma, boredom and frustration and heightened experience of family conflict, contact with the criminal justice system and homelessness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Evidence also suggests that there are barriers to accessing mental health and alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatment for people from migrant and ethnic minority backgrounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] including limited knowledge of where, why or how to seek help, fear of hospitalisation, possible adverse implications for visa applications, limited provision of culturally responsive services, and stigma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
      <sec id="Sec2">
        <title>Stigma and health</title>
        <p id="Par10">Erving Goffman described stigma as a social process in which a person or group&#x2019;s attribute, condition or status is identified as different, less desirable or dangerous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. People may experience stigma based on physical ability, individual character, health conditions, race, sexual identity, or religion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Illicit drug use and particularly, drug dependence, can be seen as categories which create stigma by their implicit definition of otherness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Since Goffman&#x2019;s work, there has been a proliferation of stigma research, particularly in relation to health. Link and Phelan conceptualised stigma as the convergence of labelling, stereotyping, separation and discrimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In this process, differences are identified, labelled as socially important, and associated with negative attributes. Separation occurs when those who are labelled are considered fundamentally different from the norm, which can lead to discrimination or status loss through being devalued, rejected or excluded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although stigma and discrimination are sometimes used interchangeably, they are distinct: stigma is a broader concept that involves multiple components (including discrimination) whereas discrimination refers to the unequal treatment or constrained opportunities of members of a social group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Discrimination can occur at an individual or structural level where institutional practices and environments create barriers to inclusion. For example, people living with HIV can experience stigma when they are framed as dangerous and immoral, which may result in discrimination in healthcare settings or rejection from social groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Internalized stigma can also occur when people apply negative stereotypes to themselves and come to expect or fear rejection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Importantly, the components of stigma can only unfold within systems of social, economic and political power that enable the assembly of stigmatising discourses or institutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Stigma has been shown to negatively affect employment, housing, access to medical care, treatment compliance and help-seeking behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It can also contribute to chronic stress which may increase hypertension and worsen existing medical conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec3">
        <title>Mental health stigma</title>
        <p id="Par11">Stigma has been examined across a variety of health conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. People with mental health conditions are often labelled as dangerous, unpredictable, incompetent and dependent on others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Importantly, stigma associated with mental health conditions is shaped by cultural values, norms and beliefs. Three reviews have examined these cultural aspects of stigma; an integrative narrative review exploring mental illness stigma among specific racial and ethnic groups in the USA, a systematic review exploring mental illness stigma among Asian, Black and Latinx Americans and a systematic review identifying meaningful cultural aspects of stigma in non-Western European cultural groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Findings from these reviews suggested that there were similarities and differences in mental illness stigma between racial and ethnic groups. For example, a common finding across groups was that negative labels associated with mental health conditions were often applied to an individual&#x2019;s family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Findings within specific ethnic groups demonstrated the importance of protecting the family reputation from mental illness stigma among Asian communities, the role of historical and current racism in shaping stigma for Black Americans and the perception that mental illness was incongruent with the hardworking values of Latino groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Studies have also documented the negative experiences of stigma for people from migrant and ethnic minority backgrounds including discrimination, prejudice, exclusion and internalised shame [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Family members associated with people who have mental health conditions may also be treated unfairly, excluded from social life and feel ashamed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Systematic reviews focused on migrant and ethnic minority populations in the USA and Europe have reported that stigma is a common barrier that prevents access to mental health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Few studies have examined how stigma associated with mental health conditions intersects with other characteristics or used theory to enhance understanding of the stigma process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec4">
        <title>Stigma associated with alcohol and other drug use</title>
        <p id="Par12">Studies have also investigated AOD use stigma and demonstrated that people who inject drugs are often perceived as immoral, irresponsible, undeserving of help, burdensome, deviant and dishonest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Stigma is also evident when people with alcohol dependence are blamed for their &#x2018;voluntary&#x2019; condition for &#x2018;choosing&#x2019; to use alcohol in ways considered unacceptable by society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Previous qualitative findings have indicated that people with substance dependence experience stigma within their interpersonal relationships, healthcare settings, the criminal justice system, the media and in political and legal systems that criminalise certain types of drug use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Stigma contributes to poor quality healthcare and hinders evidence-based responses such as supervised injecting facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. People with a dual diagnosis of a mental health condition and substance use disorder may experience higher levels of stigma and discrimination and poorer quality of healthcare than those with a single diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
        <p id="Par13">Existing studies have identified that stigma associated with AOD use is a barrier that impedes access to support for migrant and ethnic minority communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Qualitative research with young African refugees in Australia identified there were significant risks if they were discovered drinking alcohol including exclusion from their families and broader cultural communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Similarly, this sample also perceived that injecting drug use was shameful for both the individual and their families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Research with people from Pakistani Muslim backgrounds in Britain identified that alcohol consumption was perceived as dishonourable and incongruent with Islamic values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Gender is also important, with Muslim females at high risk of gossip, reputational damage and being labelled as &#x2018;poor marriage material&#x2019; if discovered consuming alcohol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The shame associated with alcohol consumption in some cultures likely encourages people to hide their alcohol consumption to avoid damaging their families reputation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Although some individual studies have investigated stigma associated with AOD use among migrant and ethnic minority groups, to our knowledge, there has been no dedicated effort to bring this body of evidence together. Other reviews that are focused more generally on AOD treatment and health promotion programmes have identified that stigma is a barrier to help-seeking but do not provide in-depth information about the process of stigma and its intersections with other characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec5">
        <title>Stigma in the lives of people from migrant and ethnic minority backgrounds</title>
        <p id="Par14">Intersectionality emphasises that multiple facets of people&#x2019;s identity and social positions interact to shape experiences of stigma and discrimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Although most existing research focuses on people&#x2019;s experience of stigma due to one health condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], intersectionality has been integrated into various stigma frameworks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In their systematic review, Fox et al. acknowledged that people&#x2019;s experiences of mental illness stigma differed based on characteristics representative of privilege and marginalisation including their specific diagnosis, socio-economic status, race, culture and gender [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Intersectionality is particularly important when considering people with migrant and ethnic minority backgrounds because they often experience discrimination based on multiple identity characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. For example, one study showed that Latinx people who injected drugs were perceived as more deserving of punishment than help in comparison to white people who injected drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Experiences of mental health and AOD use stigma may also be shaped by migration status. People from migrant and ethnic minority backgrounds are often held to higher standards than others, expected to be upstanding citizens or &#x2018;model minorities&#x2019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], so that &#x2018;deviant&#x2019; behaviour may be perceived more negatively. Further research is needed to understand the nature of the relationship between stigma associated with mental health and AOD use, and discourses and practices intersecting with culture, gender and ethnicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p>

        <title>Rationale</title>
        <p id="Par15">Stigma is a complex concept involving interrelated components and power systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Although stigma has been commonly identified as an important barrier to help-seeking among migrant and ethnic minority communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], responses to address stigma are hampered by a lack of understanding of people&#x2019;s experiences, intersectional factors, the underlying drivers and the powerful discourses, institutions and systems that enable stigma to unfold. Research has acknowledged that interventions targeting stigma must address multiple levels including social, policy and legal structures thus incorporating theory that acknowledges these structures is important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Although some reviews have explored cultural factors and mental illness stigma, these have predominantly focused on migrant and ethnic minority groups in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Our review expands the knowledge base by examining global literature and drawing on robust theory to synthesise findings. Our review will also address understudied areas of intersectional stigma and stigma in relation to AOD use. A deeper understanding of the drivers and facilitators, manifestations, intersections, outcomes&#xA0;and impacts of stigma among migrant and ethnic minority populations will guide future research and inform more socially and culturally responsive interventions.</p>

      <sec id="Sec7">
        <title>Guiding theory</title>
        <p id="Par16">Our understanding of stigma in this review draws on Bourdieu&#x2019;s concepts of symbolic power and Link and Phelan&#x2019;s concept of stigma power. Bourdieu described the term &#x2018;habitus&#x2019; which suggests that people&#x2019;s beliefs, attitudes, behaviours and knowledge are shaped by life experiences and social positions as defined by important institutions such as religion, race, gender and social class [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. People develop skills, achievements and a sense of identity that reflect their social group membership, known as cultural capital. These social institutions create power systems that value certain identities over others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Symbolic power refers to the ability to define what constitutes &#x2018;reality&#x2019;, and impose a legitimate or orthodox version of the social world on others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Stigma is a form of symbolic power because those who articulate orthodox discourses via the social order are in a strong position to determine what is legitimate, valuable and worthy. Bourdieu argues that people unconsciously accept the social hierarchy established via orthodox discourses, which means that symbolic power and associated systems such as stigma can be &#x2018;misrecognised&#x2019; as normal, and in some cases, unquestionable, cultural arrangements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Link and Phelan expanded on these ideas and proposed that stigma creates and maintains social hierarchies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Stigma power highlights how culture determines whether certain characteristics are valued or not. People with stigmatised characteristics are generally conscious of the negative labels placed upon them and the risk of being devalued or discriminated against. This awareness increases concern that people should &#x2018;stay in&#x2019; to avoid negative cultural evaluation, &#x2018;stay away&#x2019; from potentially threatening environments and &#x2018;stay down&#x2019; by accepting their lower worth. In this regard, stigma power is a resource that acts to perpetuate existing arrangements of power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p>
        <p id="Par17">Our review will be guided by the Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework which acknowledges that multiple domains interact to produce stigma (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. This framework will be used to formulate our research questions, synthesise the data from included studies and identify where gaps in the literature remain and where future interventions could be targeted. Drivers are conceptualised as inherently negative factors that enable stigma (e.g. fear of people with a mental health condition) and facilitators are societal factors that can have positive or negative influences on stigmatisation, for example, cultural and gender norms. The drivers and facilitators of stigma reflect Bourdieu&#x2019;s idea that within any society, certain cultural attributes are defined as worthy or orthodox&#x2014;or in some cases unquestionable&#x2014;while others are devalued. Drivers and facilitators combine to determine whether a person or group are &#x2018;marked&#x2019; based on their stigmatised characteristic. &#x2018;Stigma marking&#x2019; occurs when stigma is applied to a person or group based on their mental health condition and/or AOD use. This health-related stigma may also intersect with stigma related to other factors such as ethnicity, gender and citizenship status. Once people have been &#x2018;marked&#x2019;, stigma can manifest as experiences (lived realities such as discrimination and internalised, anticipated, perceived and secondary stigma) and practices (the beliefs, attitudes and actions directed towards a stigmatised person or group). Stigmatisation also leads to &#x2018;outcomes&#x2019; for affected populations and organisations (such as access to treatment and support) and impacts on broader health consequences (e.g. quality of life and relationships) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Importantly, the framework explicitly states that stigma is not &#x2018;a thing which individuals impose on others&#x2019; but relies on the broader social, cultural, political and economic forces that structure stigma. This reference to systems of power relates to Bourdieu&#x2019;s concept of symbolic power and Link and Phelan&#x2019;s description of stigma power.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13643_2021_1875_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

This approach is well suited to qualitative reviews where a suitable theoretical framework already exists.

          <p id="Par54">Two reviewers will pilot test the framework on five included studies and refine sub-domains, topic codes and definitions through discussion. One reviewer will then apply the framework to each included article by highlighting relevant sections of the results and coding the data to the topic codes, sub-domains and domains outlined in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Data that will be coded include direct quotes from participants and the primary authors&#x2019; description of results given that their interpretation is generally supported by additional data and contextual information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In articles that include additional participants who do not meet the inclusion criteria, only data from migrant and ethnic minority participants will be coded. A second reviewer will code one quarter of the articles to ensure the framework is consistently applied; any discrepancies will be resolved through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer. Data that do not fit the framework, will be assigned to an &#x2018;other&#x2019; code; these excerpts will be reviewed, inductively coded and presented in an adapted version of the framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p>
          <p id="Par55">Throughout the coding process, reviewers will create memos to record their insights on the data and document links between codes. One reviewer will create a summary of each article to capture the main findings related to stigma. One reviewer will draw on the coded data, memos and article summaries to synthesise the key findings for each domain of the Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework. All co-authors will reflect upon and refine the synthesised findings, which will then be written as a narrative with supporting quotes from the included studies. Findings will also be visualised through presenting the adapted version of the framework that best fits the included studies. Importantly, data synthesis will be shaped by the positionality of the review team which is made up of academics with backgrounds in AOD, sociology, young people&#x2019;s health, migrant inclusion and social cohesion based in Australia and Myanmar.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="Par57">In this paper, we describe the protocol for a systematic review of qualitative studies exploring the stigma associated with AOD use and mental health conditions among migrant and ethnic minority groups. Stigma has been identified as a major barrier to accessing support for AOD use and mental health conditions among migrant and ethnic minority communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Existing evidence suggests that further research underpinned by theory is needed to understand the intersectional factors that influence AOD use and mental health stigma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Use of best fit framework analysis guided by the Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework will enable us to provide insight into the different domains of stigma, identify gaps in the literature and provide recommendations for future research.</p>
      <p id="Par58">Any important updates to the protocol will be dated and track changed in PROSPERO. Additionally, results from this review will be shared with policy-makers and service providers to inform future policy responses and healthcare delivery. Limitations of this review include the exclusion of studies published in languages other than English. We also acknowledge that qualitative systematic reviews involve taking findings out of their original context and synthesising data to answer new research questions, which is particularly complex when studies include multiple countries and cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Importantly, the evidence generated from this review will be used to advocate for culturally responsive interventions that aim to reduce the negative outcomes of stigma for individuals, families and communities.</p>
