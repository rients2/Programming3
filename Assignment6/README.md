# Programming3
The programming 3 final assignment made by Rients Dalstra. <br> <br>
I have chosen to work on Project 2: The PubMed literature database. <br>
In the python_files folder all files can be found required to answer the question. <br> 
<br>
They can all be run by running the assignment6.sh file. <br>
The pickle files required to answer both questions already exists, therefore it is possible to just run question1.py and question5.py by themselves.
