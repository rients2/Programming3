# Programming3

In the python_files folder all files can be found required to answer the question. <br> <br>
They can all be run by running the assignment6.sh file, however this will take a long time. <br>
The pickle files required to answer both questions already exists, therefore it is possible to just run question1.py and question5.py by themselves.
Question5.py will still take  ~24 hours to run.
