First, the electron denisty distribution at 5.5 A resolution was examined. A local 2-fold axis that transposes the C-D helix pair into the A-B helix pair was found and refined by the method of least squares. The match in electron densities for a pure 2-fold rotation had a correlation coefficient of 0.56. Next, a comprehensive search was made for rotational symmetry in the Patterson function of an isolated molecule. The rotation function based on data to 6 A spacings showed a major peak, 72% of the self-peak height, that confirmed the result from electron density correlations. In addition, a pattern of lower level peaks revealed approximate point group symmetry as high as D4. Finally, the amino acid sequence has been inspected for evidence of a repeated structure. The level of amino acid identities between positions in the A-B and C-D helix pairs is 28%. Several factors are discussed to suggest that this homology, although low, is nonetheless significant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hendrickson", "ForeName": "W A", "Initials": "WA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ward", "ForeName": "K B", "Initials": "KB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hemerythrin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Macromolecular Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metalloproteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "myohemerythrin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crystallography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fourier Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Hemerythrin"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Invertebrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Macromolecular Substances"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Metalloproteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Structural"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Muscles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Conformation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1977", "Month": "5", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["856811", "S0021-9258(17)40465-0"]}}
